    "summary": "I've spent the last few years focused on building and maintaining reliable, scalable infrastructure. I enjoy making systems easy to operate and resilient under pressure, whether that's through automation, smart architecture, or thoughtful processes.<br /><br />I'm especially interested in cloud infrastructure and distributed systems, and I enjoy working on platforms that enable development teams to move quickly without sacrificing stability. I care about clean, maintainable solutions and believe reliability should be a product feature, not an afterthought.",
