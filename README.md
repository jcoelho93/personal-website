This is my personal website built using ReactJS and Bulma as the CSS framework. [Live here](https://jcoelho93.netlify.com)

The personal information on the website is populated from a json file that follows the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) open source standard.

## Customizing it

Feel free to fork this project and update it with your own information and style. Just update the ´src/resume.json´ with your personal information.

If you improve the app in any way a PR would be very apreciated ;)

## Build

```console
> git clone https://github.com/jcoelho93/personal-website.git

2. Update the *resume.json* with your personal information (check [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/))

3. Install dependencies and run build command:
